# UIC-Human-Resource-ReVamp
This repository contains snapshots of the improved version of University of Illinois's Human Resource Website, which I  developed, while working as a Web Developer at UIC. 
I have used Html, Css, JavaScript, JQuery, XSLT & SitePublish tools for writing the code.
This version is still under development and will be in production soon.
