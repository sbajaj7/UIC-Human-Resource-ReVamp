# UIC-Human-Resource-ReVamp
This repository contains snapshots of the improved version of University of Illinois's Human Resource Website, which I  developed, while working as a Web Developer at UIC. 
I have used Html, Css, JavaScript, JQuery, XSLT & SitePublish tools for writing the code.
<p>UIC Human Resources is committed to providing timely and effective support through human resource management expertise for faculty, staff and administrators. This version of our website is still under development and will be replacing the current UIC's Human Resource Website entirely.</p>
